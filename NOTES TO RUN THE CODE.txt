The code is based on ipython notebook format.
python-dependecies(libraries): sklearn,bs4(beautiful-soup),textblob,nltk
To install any of the library run either of the following command:
1. pip install <library-name> (for ex. pip install bs4)
2. apt-get install python-<library-name> (for ex. apt-get install nltk)

Intermediate data-structures (needed to convert raw-data into Bag-of-Words(BOG) format are saved as 'pickle' objects)
They can be readily loaded to avoid preprocessing of raw HTML files

The dataset is explained on this page:
